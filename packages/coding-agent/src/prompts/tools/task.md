# Inputs
`name`: CamelCase ≤32, auto-generated if omitted; address agent by name. `outputSchema` overrides agent/session schemas.
`solutionSpace`: describe how open-ended the child's problem is: whether the fix or design is given, or which causes or designs remain open. Volume of work does not widen it; NEVER mention sibling agents or coordination. (`one fix: rename, names given`; `one fix: slice end in paginate`; `single-flight cache load; races easy to miss`; `several retry API shapes; error classes to choose`; `deadlock cause open, no repro`)
`sourceSession`: seance-only fork source; REQUIRED with `agent: "seance"` and rejected for other agents.
`model`: optional seance-only selector or ordered selector list; see Seance below.
{{#if evalToolsEnabled}}`tools`: eval-defined, run in your kernel.
{{/if}}{{#if effortEnabled}}`effort`: `"lo"`|`"med"`|`"hi"` by how open-ended the problem is.
{{/if}}`schemaMode`: default permissive warns after retries; strict fails.
{{#if isolationEnabled}}{{#if applyIsolatedChanges}}`isolated`: worktree; successful changes apply to parent.
{{else}}`isolated`: worktree; changes retained, not applied.
{{/if}}{{/if}}Children start blank;{{#if ircEnabled}} parent IRC steers immediately;{{/if}} large payloads via `local://<path>`, NEVER inline.

# Format
{{#if batchEnabled}}`context`: shared (`# Goal`, `# Contract` interfaces); NEVER repeat per task.
{{/if}}`task`: self-contained (`# Target` files/non-goals, `# Change` steps/APIs, `# Acceptance` observable result).

# Available Agents

# Seance
Use `agent: "seance"` to consult a prior persisted session without switching the parent. Set `sourceSession` to its id prefix or JSONL path; the source is forked and never modified. Seance has `read`, `grep`, `glob`, and `yield` only; later parent messages wake it through IRC, and its yielded answer is relayed automatically. It does not need `write` to reply.

Without `model`, seance bypasses inherited task/agent model defaults and restores the fork's saved active-role, then its saved default model. If neither model is recorded or neither recorded model can be restored, fail and tell the user to rerun with `model`; NEVER send the history to an arbitrary model. An explicit `model` uses normal task model priority and auth fallback. Report the resolved model; if restoration falls back from the unavailable saved active-role to the saved default, report that saved-model fallback.

```json
{
  "agent": "seance",
  "sourceSession": "abc123",
  "model": ["provider/model", "@role"],
  "task": "Consult the inherited history and prepare to answer follow-up questions.",
  "solutionSpace": "The source is fixed; future questions determine the answer."
}
```
